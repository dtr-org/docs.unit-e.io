Update of Unit-e Alpha Testnet
==============================

On June 7 2019 there will be a reset of the alpha testnet as part of a
scheduled maintenance update after running it for more than half a million
blocks. The update will bring the nodes run by the Unit-e development team to
the latest version of the code and start a fresh blockchain.

The update contains some changes which are not compatible with older versions,
in particular the 0.1.0 version. If you have been running a node paticipating in
the testnet you need to check out the latest version of the `testnet` branch and
recompile your client. Remove the unit-e data directory before starting the
client to get the new testnet blockchain.

See the :ref:`testnet` documentation for general instructions how to participate
in the testnet. The testnet still is at an early stage. It will gradually be
ramped up to provide more features and might be reset to incorporate changes
which are not backwards compatible in the future as well.
