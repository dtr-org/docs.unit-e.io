That is, transactions which are in the receiving node’s memory pool. The response to the "mempool" message is one or more "inv" messages containing the TXIDs in the usual inventory format.

Sending the "mempool" message is mostly useful when a program first connects to the network. Full nodes can use it to quickly gather most or all of the unconfirmed transactions available on the network; this is especially useful for miners trying to gather transactions for their transaction fees. SPV clients can set a filter before sending a ``mempool`` to only receive transactions that match that filter; this allows a recently-started client to get most or all unconfirmed transactions related to its wallet.

An "inv" message is limited to 50,000 inventories. The node sends as many "inv" messages as needed to reference its complete memory pool.

The ``inv`` response to the "mempool" message is, at best, one node’s view of the network, not a complete list of unconfirmed transactions on the network. Here are some additional reasons the list might not be complete:

-  The "mempool" message is not currently fully compatible with the "filterload" message’s ``BLOOM_UPDATE_ALL`` and ``BLOOM_UPDATE_P2PUBKEY_ONLY`` flags. Mempool transactions are not sorted like in-block transactions, so a transaction (tx2) spending an output can appear before the transaction (tx1) containing that output, which means the automatic filter update mechanism won’t operate until the second-appearing transaction (tx1) is seen—missing the first-appearing transaction (tx2). It has been proposed in [Bitcoin Core issue #2381](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/2381) that the transactions should be sorted before being processed by the filter.

There is no payload in a "mempool" message. See the [message header section](intro:message-header) for an example of a message without a payload.
